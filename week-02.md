# Learning Journal: Week 2

## Learning Activities
After watching the lecture, I watched the demo on using Vagrant and ScotchBox to set up a local Joomla environment. While watching the demo, I read thte documentation for Vagrant and Joomla to better understand how they worked.

To test my set-up, I first hosted my site from prac 1 on the VM server to test. Then, after installing Joomla on the same server, I changed the content and settings of the default theme to match my startup business.

## Resources/Links
* [Command-Line Interface on Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/cli)
* [Installing Joomla on Joomla Documentation](https://docs.joomla.org/J4.x:Installing_Joomla)

## Estimated Hours
10 hours

## Content Insights
I learned that while similar in some ways, Docker is a containerisation tool, which separates applications and their runtimes from the machine they run on, while Vagrant is a virtualisation tool, which separates applications and the machines they run on from the physical machines hosting them. 

## Career or Employability Insights
I found that watching or seeing a demo that uses one or more tools *while* referring to their documentation makes it much easier to understand: the demo effectively shows an immediate, real-world usage of a selection of features, while the documentation lays out the usage in more general tersm to show how the same process can be applied in other situations.
