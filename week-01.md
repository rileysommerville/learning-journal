# Learning Journal: Week 1

## Learning Activities
After watching the lecture I watched the CMS video from the linked course on the subject calendar.

During the practical, after building my site locally, I searched for a deployment option and found GitHub Pages. After reading through the documentation to learn how it worked, I enabled it for my repo and set ot to automatically build from the root folder.

In the GitHub Pages documentation I found that GitHub supports Jekyll sites. I read through the Jekyll documentation to learn about how it worked — a static site generator, very similar to a CMS except that the site is converted to static files at the time of deployment rather than kept in a database and built on demand. I then read the documentation page for Liquid templating in Jekyll.

Completed practical: [OverPro](https://rileysommerville.github.io/overpro/)

My site describes a startup that creates custom video titles and overlay setups for streaming services. It presents an overview of the business in a single-page design. Note that links to other pages have been intentionally omitted (they don't exist yet).

## Content Insights
From the LinkedIn Learning video and the Jekyll documentation I learned that there are a wide variety of CMSs which work in very different ways. I was intially under hte impression that they were all bloated, slow, overbearing systems that were only useful for managing dizzying amounts of information, but I have since learned that there are many which work well even for small sites and which are lean and performant.

## Career or Employability Insights
There are plenty of CMSs out in the wild, but they all boil down to `data + presentation = content`, where you supply the data and (at least some of) the presentation, and the CMS presents the content.
