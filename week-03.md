# Learning Journal: Week 3

## Learning Activities

After watching the lecture demo, I went to my hosting provider to set up a WordPress installation on my site.

I copied my content from my Joomla site, which included several pages, but I forgot to change the category and commenting settings at the time I created these pages, so I found and used the bulk page editor onthhe WordPress dashboard to make all of my changes simultaneously.
