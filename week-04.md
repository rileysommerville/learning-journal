# Learning Journal: Week 4

## Learning Activities

After watching the lecture and demo, I set up a WordPress installation on my local machine. This was easy, having done it in the weeks before. After setting up my site, I got familiar with the layout of WordPress' files (`wp-content`) and some of the processes that are involved with transferring sites between installations.
